# kide

kreatos Neovim setup, packaged to build **offline from source** on
RHEL9. Everything the build needs is in this repo; the build never touches the
network, and `vendor/` holds no binaries and no upstream `.git*` files (checked by
`scripts/check-sources.py`; the root `.gitignore` is the only one).

The C/C++ build environment (RHEL toolchain and libraries, CMake 4,
onnxruntime, ACE+TAO, OpenDDS, GDAL) is a separate repo, **ibn-dev**: a
podman image the kide image can be built on top of
([In a podman container](#in-a-podman-container)).

## Install (on the RHEL9 box)

The repo is hosted on GitLab as `kreatos/kide`. One call does
everything:

    curl -fsSL https://gitlab.com/kreatos/kide/-/raw/main/install.sh \
      | KIDE_TARBALL=https://gitlab.com/kreatos/kide/-/archive/main/kide-main.tar.gz bash

1. Installs the RHEL packages that are missing (asks for your sudo
   password): the build toolchain (gcc, make, cmake, python3, rust-toolset,
   golang), tar, git-core, tmux, fd-find, ripgrep, bat, and the
   [C/C++ tools](#cc-development) kide uses from RHEL. All from the box's
   configured dnf repos (install.sh adds no repos); fd-find, ripgrep and bat
   are from EPEL, so EPEL must be enabled.
2. Downloads this repo as a tarball into a temp dir (removed afterwards).
3. Builds and installs kreatos-ide offline into `~/.local/kreatos-ide`
   (`build-ide.sh`, ~5 min).
4. Opens a new shell in which `kide` works. Every later shell finds it too.

`install.sh` holds no repo URL: piped from `curl` it downloads the tarball
given in `KIDE_TARBALL` and stops with an error if it is not set (a checkout
or unpacked tarball needs no `KIDE_TARBALL`). Self-hosted GitLab: replace `gitlab.com`
with its host. The repo has to be public: `install.sh` downloads with plain
`curl`, without a token. Mirror on GitHub: see [Install from GitHub](#install-from-github).

No internet on the box: see [Offline install from the tarball](#offline-install-from-the-tarball).
Another prefix: `./install.sh /opt/kide`, or `curl … | KIDE_TARBALL=… bash -s /opt/kide`.

Config-only update of an existing install (seconds, no compiling): plugins,
nvim and yazi config, `kide` launcher and `PREFIX/bashrc` are refreshed;
nvim, the treesitter parsers and the tools stay as they are:

    curl -fsSL https://gitlab.com/kreatos/kide/-/raw/main/install.sh \
      | KIDE_TARBALL=https://gitlab.com/kreatos/kide/-/archive/main/kide-main.tar.gz bash -s -- --no-build

(`./install.sh --no-build [PREFIX]` from a checkout.) A change to Neovim, the
parser list or a tool still needs the full install.

Everything is installed inside `PREFIX`. The only change outside it is
one line `build-ide.sh` adds to `~/.bashrc` (once), sourcing
`PREFIX/bashrc`, which
puts `PREFIX/bin` at the front of `PATH`, so `kide` and the bundled tools are
found first in every new shell.

`kide` runs the bundled nvim with the bundled config, with the bundled LSP
servers and formatters (`PREFIX/bin`) first on `PATH`. Its data, state and
cache live under `NVIM_APPNAME=kreatos-ide` (`~/.local/share/kreatos-ide`, …),
so it never mixes with another nvim. The repo is only read; intermediate files
go to `$KIDE_BUILD_DIR` (default `/tmp/kide-build`, safe to delete afterwards).

### Install from GitHub

Same install from the GitHub copy `kreatos/kide`:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kreatos/kide/main/install.sh \
      | KIDE_TARBALL=https://github.com/kreatos/kide/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz bash

Arguments the same way, e.g. config-only update:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kreatos/kide/main/install.sh \
      | KIDE_TARBALL=https://github.com/kreatos/kide/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz bash -s -- --no-build

### Offline install from the tarball

For a RHEL9 box without internet. The build itself never needs the network;
only the repo tarball has to get there, and the RHEL packages have to come
from somewhere.

1. On any machine with internet, download the tarball (or use a copy someone
   gave you):

       curl -fLo kide-main.tar.gz https://gitlab.com/kreatos/kide/-/archive/main/kide-main.tar.gz

2. Copy it to the RHEL9 box (USB stick, `scp`, …).
3. RHEL packages: `install.sh` installs the missing ones with `dnf`, which
   needs a reachable repo — on an offline box the company mirror/Satellite or
   a local repo from the RHEL9 DVD ISO. If none is reachable, get them
   installed beforehand: `install.sh` only calls `dnf` for packages that are
   missing, and stops if `dnf` fails. The full list:

       sudo dnf install gcc make cmake python3 rust-toolset golang findutils diffutils tar \
           git-core gcc-c++ clang-tools-extra gdb lldb file tmux fd-find ripgrep bat

   `fd-find`, `ripgrep` and `bat` come from EPEL, so the box needs EPEL enabled;
   everything else is from the RHEL repos.

4. Unpack and install (into `~/.local/kreatos-ide`, ~5 min; an argument picks
   another prefix, e.g. `./install.sh /opt/kide`):

       tar -xzf kide-main.tar.gz
       cd kide-main*/
       ./install.sh

   From an unpacked tree `install.sh` skips the download and does the other
   steps listed above (packages, build, new shell). The tree is only
   read; it can be deleted afterwards.

Updating offline: bring over a new tarball, unpack it, and run `./install.sh`
(full rebuild) or `./install.sh --no-build` (config only) in it.

### In a podman container

No install on the host at all, only podman. The image
(`podman/Containerfile.kide`) is built on top of a base image (default Rocky
Linux 9, RHEL9-compatible; UBI9 lacks what the EPEL packages need): the IDE
in `/opt/kide` and the few RHEL packages it uses, with fish. Built on top of
**ibn-dev** (the build environment, separate repo:
`--build-arg BASE=localhost/ibn-dev`), it is the complete environment;
built on the plain base, only the IDE.

Details and limits: [podman/README.md](podman/README.md).

Build it (~5–10 min). The build does not use the tarball itself: it
copies the repo **directory** you point it at into the image
and runs `build-ide.sh` there. The last argument of `podman build` is that
directory (the "build context"); `-f` names the Containerfile inside it.
Two ways to give it the repo:

- **From the unpacked tarball (or a git checkout).** Unpack anywhere and run
  the build from the top directory of the repo, where `install.sh` and
  `podman/` are; the `.` at the end means "this directory":

      tar -xzf kide-main.tar.gz
      cd kide-main*/
      podman build --build-arg-file podman/base.conf -t kide -f podman/Containerfile.kide .

  On top of ibn-dev (built first, in its repo), add
  `--build-arg BASE=localhost/ibn-dev`. Run from anywhere else, give the
  path instead of `.`:
  `podman build --build-arg-file ~/kide/podman/base.conf -t kide -f ~/kide/podman/Containerfile.kide ~/kide`
  (with the tree unpacked to `~/kide`).
  The directory is only read and can be deleted once the image is built.

- **Straight from GitLab** (no tarball, no checkout; podman clones the repo
  itself; public project only):

      podman build --build-arg BASE=docker.io/rockylinux/rockylinux:9 --build-arg CONF_DIR=podman/conf --build-arg KIDE_USER=default --build-arg KIDE_UID=1001 --build-arg KIDE_GID=1001 -t kide -f podman/Containerfile.kide https://gitlab.com/kreatos/kide.git

  (the arg file is local, so the base image is given directly)

Either way the `dnf install` steps in the Containerfile download packages
(Rocky + EPEL repos), so the build needs internet or a mirror. For a box
without either, see the end of this section.

Run it on your `~/workspace` (rootless podman, as your normal user — not
`sudo podman` — so files kide writes stay yours).

`podman/start.sh` does exactly this (it creates `~/workspace` if missing,
takes the uid/gid from `podman/base.conf` and passes on `TERM` and
`SSH_CONNECTION`). It starts fish; `kide` opens the IDE from there, so
nvim and what it runs (builds, tests, the debugger) get the shell hooks'
environment. With file arguments kide opens them right away (via fish) and
quitting it ends the container. For git over SSH it
loads your key `~/.ssh/gitlab` into an ssh-agent for the session (asking for
its passphrase, if any) and passes the agent in (with
`--security-opt label=disable`, as SELinux blocks the agent socket otherwise),
plus `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and `~/.gitconfig` read-only; all three files must
exist:

    podman/start.sh                       # fish in ~/workspace; then: kide
    podman/start.sh myproject/src/main.py # kide on a file, relative to ~/workspace

By hand (`start.sh` also adds `-e TERM -e SSH_CONNECTION`):

    podman run --rm -it --http-proxy=false --userns=keep-id:uid=1001,gid=1001 -v "$HOME/workspace:/workspace:Z" -v kide-data:/var/lib/kide kide
    podman run --rm -it --http-proxy=false --userns=keep-id:uid=1001,gid=1001 -v "$HOME/workspace:/workspace:Z" -v kide-data:/var/lib/kide kide fish -c 'kide $argv' myproject/src/main.py

- `-v "$HOME/workspace:/workspace:Z"`: your `~/workspace` on the host (create it once: `mkdir -p ~/workspace`),
  mounted on `/workspace`, the container's working directory: kide and fish
  start there, whatever directory you start from. `:Z` relabels it for SELinux
  (needed on RHEL). A file argument is relative to it (e.g.
  `kide myproject/src/main.py`). `~/workspace/.container/` holds the shells' hooks (in the container
  `/workspace/.container/`): at every shell start, bash and fish place the
  image's own hooks in `bash/` and `fish/` there (kide: `20-kide.sh`/`.fish`;
  on top of ibn-dev also its `10-ibn-dev.*`), then source every `*.sh`
  (bash) or `*.fish` (fish) there in name order. Your own config (aliases,
  PATH, …) goes into files of your own next to them, e.g. `50-my.fish`, kept
  on the host; the image's hooks are overwritten when the image has a newer
  version. kide's hook keeps the fish and bash history (Ctrl-R) in
  `~/workspace/.container/kide/` (`fish_history`, `bash_history`). Likewise tmux reads
  `~/workspace/.container/tmux.conf` last, if it exists, after the image's
  `/etc/tmux.conf` (mouse on), and git reads
  `~/workspace/.container/.gitconfig` (your `[user] name`/`email`, …), if it
  exists, via an include in the image's `/etc/gitconfig`; a global config
  (`start.sh`'s mounted `~/.gitconfig`) overrides the same keys.
- `-v kide-data:/var/lib/kide`: kide's data and state survive the container;
  leave it out for a throwaway session.
- `--userns=keep-id:uid=1001,gid=1001`: the image runs as the user `default`
  (uid/gid 1001, `podman/base.conf`), not root; this maps you on the host to
  it, so it can write the project and the files stay yours (podman 4.3+).
- The container starts fish (lazygit, yazi, cmake, gdb on `PATH`, the
  IDE's aliases, e.g. `lg` = lazygit; see `podman/README.md`); `kide` opens
  the IDE.

As an alias in `~/.bashrc`:

    alias kide='podman run --rm -it --http-proxy=false --userns=keep-id:uid=1001,gid=1001 -v "$HOME/workspace:/workspace:Z" -v kide-data:/var/lib/kide kide'

Offline box: build the image on a machine with internet and carry it over as
a file:

    podman save -o kide-image.tar kide          # on the connected machine
    podman load -i kide-image.tar               # on the offline box, then run as above

### Remote: kide over SSH from Windows (PuTTY)

kide runs on the RHEL9 box (in the podman container, or a normal install);
PuTTY on Windows is only the terminal. Nothing is installed on Windows except
PuTTY (0.71 or newer, for 24-bit colour) and a font.

**One-time PuTTY setup** (set it, then save the session under *Session →
Saved Sessions → Save*):

| PuTTY setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| *Session*: Host Name, Port | the RHEL box, `22`, *SSH* | |
| *Connection → Data*: Terminal-type string | `xterm-256color` | kide's colours (default `xterm` gives a washed-out theme) |
| *Connection*: Seconds between keepalives | `30` | idle sessions are not dropped by firewalls |
| *Window → Translation*: Remote character set | `UTF-8` | icons and box drawing |
| *Window → Appearance*: Font | a **Nerd Font Mono**, e.g. *JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono* (install the `.ttf` on Windows first, from <https://www.nerdfonts.com>) | kide's icons (file types, git, diagnostics); without it they show as boxes |
| *Window*: Columns × Rows | at least `120 × 35` | room for the file tree and pickers |

#### Ready-made session with the kreatos colours (`putty/kide.reg`)

`putty/kide.reg` creates the PuTTY session **kide** with the kreatos ethereal
colours (22 colours from the kreatos theme's `ghostty.conf`), so the terminal
background and colours match kreatos. It also sets JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono
10 pt, terminal type `xterm-256color`, 24-bit colour, and as *Connection → SSH →
Remote command* it starts the kide container (fish):

    podman run --rm -it --http-proxy=false -e TERM -e SSH_CONNECTION --userns=keep-id:uid=1001,gid=1001 -v "$HOME/workspace:/workspace:Z" -v kide-data:/var/lib/kide kide

The container mounts your `~/workspace` on the RHEL box (create it once:
`mkdir -p ~/workspace`) and starts fish there; `cd` to the project, `kide`
opens it. Your own fish config: `*.fish` files of your own in `~/workspace/.container/fish/` ([hooks](#in-a-podman-container)). Leaving
fish (`exit`) ends the container and the PuTTY session. Needs the `kide` image
on the RHEL box ([In a podman container](#in-a-podman-container)). For a plain
login shell instead (e.g. a normal install), clear the remote command in PuTTY
and save.

Install (no admin rights needed: it writes only to
`HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\kide`):

1. Install the font **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font**: download
   <https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/JetBrainsMono.zip>
   (project page: <https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads>), unzip, select the
   `JetBrainsMonoNerdFontMono-*.ttf` files, right-click → **Install** (not
   "Install for all users" — the per-user install needs no admin rights).
2. Copy `putty/kide.reg` to the Windows machine.
3. Import it: double-click the file, or run `reg import kide.reg`.
   If `regedit`/`reg.exe` are blocked by policy, set the 22 colours by hand in
   PuTTY → Window → Colours instead (values are in the file, `Colour0`…`Colour21`).
4. In PuTTY, load **kide**, enter the host and port, set the keepalive and
   window size from the table above, and click **Save**.

If the font is not installed, PuTTY falls back to a default font. Importing
again overwrites only the colours, font, terminal type and remote command of
that session; host, port and other settings stay. Not tested on Windows yet.

**Each time:**

1. Open the saved session, log in.
2. A kide started like in step 3 ends when the SSH connection ends (logout,
   or a dropped connection). Unsaved changes can be recovered with `:recover`
   next time (the swap files are in the `kide-data` volume). To keep kide
   running across logouts and disconnects, use
   [the persistent setup below](#persistent-kide-survives-ssh-logout) instead
   of step 3.
3. Start the kide container (fish in `~/workspace`; `cd` to the project, `kide` opens it):

       podman run --rm -it --http-proxy=false -e TERM -e SSH_CONNECTION --userns=keep-id:uid=1001,gid=1001 -v "$HOME/workspace:/workspace:Z" -v kide-data:/var/lib/kide kide

   - `-e TERM` hands PuTTY's `xterm-256color` to the container (podman would
     set plain `xterm`).
   - `-e SSH_CONNECTION` tells kide it runs over SSH, so yanks stay inside
     kide instead of trying to reach a clipboard the container does not have
     (without it every yank shows `clipboard: No provider`).

   As an alias in `~/.bashrc` on the RHEL box:

       alias kide='podman run --rm -it --http-proxy=false -e TERM -e SSH_CONNECTION --userns=keep-id:uid=1001,gid=1001 -v "$HOME/workspace:/workspace:Z" -v kide-data:/var/lib/kide kide'

   With a normal install (no container) it is just `kide`.

**Using it in PuTTY:**

- Mouse works in kide (click, scroll, resize splits), so kide gets plain
  clicks, right-click included. Hold **Shift** to use PuTTY's own selection
  and paste instead (in the fish shell a plain right-click pastes).
- **Ctrl+Shift+C / Ctrl+Shift+V**: off by default in PuTTY. Turn on
  *Window → Selection → Shift+Ctrl+[C,V]: System clipboard* (the `kide`
  session from `putty/kide.reg` has it on: `"CtrlShiftCV"="explicit"`).
- **Copy to Windows**: Shift + drag selects text in PuTTY, which copies it to
  the Windows clipboard right away (Ctrl+Shift+C copies the selection again).
  kide's own yank (`y`) does not reach Windows: PuTTY does not support
  OSC 52.
- **Paste from Windows**: Ctrl+Shift+V, Shift + right-click or Shift + Insert.
  It arrives as a bracketed paste, so the text is inserted as is (no
  auto-indent mess), in insert and in normal mode.
- Alt keys (`<A-j>`/`<A-k>` move lines) work: PuTTY sends Alt as Esc + key.
- Window resize: drag the PuTTY window; kide redraws.
- Only the mounted project directory is visible inside the container (see
  [podman/README.md](podman/README.md) § Limits).

#### Windows Terminal instead of PuTTY (`windows-terminal/kide.json`)

Same session as `putty/kide.reg` (colours, font, keepalive, the container as
remote command), but Windows Terminal supports OSC 52: yazi's `cc`, `ffex` and
nvim's `"+y` copy to the Windows clipboard. Inside tmux this also needs
`set -g set-clipboard on` (e.g. in `~/workspace/.container/tmux.conf`).

1. Font as for PuTTY (step 1 above).
2. Windows Terminal → Settings → *Open JSON file*; merge the three parts of
   `windows-terminal/kide.json` (`schemes`, `profiles.list`, `actions`) into
   the lists of the same name, and replace `USER@RHEL-HOST`.
3. SSH key: Windows' `ssh.exe` reads OpenSSH keys from `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\`,
   not `.ppk`; export a PuTTY key once with PuTTYgen → *Conversions → Export
   OpenSSH key*.

Differences from PuTTY: Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V are unbound in every tab (copy and
paste are Ctrl+Shift+C / Ctrl+Shift+V), and Windows Terminal keeps some keys
for itself (Ctrl+Shift+T/W/F/P/D, Alt+Shift+±, Alt+arrows, Alt+Enter). Shift +
drag still selects. Not tested on Windows yet.

### Persistent kide (survives SSH logout)

If the RHEL box kills a user's processes at logout (systemd-logind
`KillUserProcesses=yes`, or lingering is off), a container started from the
SSH shell dies with it, and so does `tmux`. Two things fix that:

- the container runs as a **systemd user service**, not as a child of the
  SSH session, and
- inside it kide runs as a **Neovim server** (`--headless --listen`). Each
  login attaches a UI to it (`--remote-ui`); closing the UI, a logout or a
  dropped connection leaves the server running, with all open buffers, undo
  history, LSP servers and `:terminal`s. This is Neovim's own client/server
  mode, so no tmux is needed. (kide bundles tmux, but a tmux server inside a
  container started from the SSH shell dies with it as well.)

Needs podman 4.4 or newer for Quadlet (RHEL 9.2+; check `podman --version`)
and the `kide` image built as **the same user** that runs it (rootless images
belong to the user who built them).

**Root needed?** Only for things an admin may have done already:

- podman installed (`sudo dnf install podman`) and subuid/subgid ranges for
  your user, which rootless podman needs anyway (normally created by
  `useradd`; check with `grep "$USER" /etc/subuid /etc/subgid`).
- possibly linger (step 1), once: depending on the systemd version and site
  policy, `loginctl enable-linger` for yourself may be refused, especially
  over SSH; then an admin runs `sudo loginctl enable-linger <your user>`.

Everything else (building the image, the unit file in your home,
`systemctl --user`, attaching, detaching, restarting) runs as your normal
user, without sudo.

**Set it up once** (on the RHEL box, as your normal user):

1. Let your user services run without a login session (linger):

       loginctl enable-linger
       loginctl show-user "$USER" -p Linger     # must say Linger=yes

   If that is refused, an admin runs `sudo loginctl enable-linger <your user>`.

2. The directory kide may see is your `~/workspace`, mounted on the
   container's `/workspace` (every project under it is reachable from the
   one kide):

       mkdir -p ~/workspace

3. Create the unit file `~/.config/containers/systemd/kide.container`
   (`mkdir -p ~/.config/containers/systemd` first):

       [Unit]
       Description=kide (Neovim server in podman)

       [Container]
       Image=localhost/kide:latest
       ContainerName=kide
       # kide as a server, no UI; started from fish for the shell hooks'
       # environment (the image's command is fish)
       Exec=fish -c "kide --headless --listen /tmp/kide.sock"
       Volume=%h/workspace:/workspace:Z
       Volume=kide-data:/var/lib/kide
       UserNS=keep-id:uid=1001,gid=1001
       # no proxy variables from the host (podman run --http-proxy=false)
       PodmanArgs=--http-proxy=false
       Environment=TERM=xterm-256color SSH_CONNECTION=persistent

       [Service]
       # :qa ends the server; start a fresh one right away
       Restart=always

       [Install]
       WantedBy=default.target

4. Start it (and on every boot from now on, thanks to `[Install]` + linger):

       systemctl --user daemon-reload
       systemctl --user start kide
       systemctl --user status kide              # active (running)

**Use it** (every SSH/PuTTY login):

    podman exec -it -e TERM kide kide --server /tmp/kide.sock --remote-ui

As an alias in `~/.bashrc` on the RHEL box:

    alias kide-attach='podman exec -it -e TERM kide kide --server /tmp/kide.sock --remote-ui'

| You do | Effect |
|---|---|
| `:detach` | UI closes, back at the shell; kide keeps running with everything open |
| close PuTTY, log out, connection drops | same as `:detach` |
| `kide-attach` | back where you left off |
| `:qa` | kide really quits (asks about unsaved files); systemd starts a fresh, empty one, ready for the next `kide-attach` |
| `:e ~/…` | not visible: only `/workspace` (= the host's `~/workspace`) is mounted; open files as `:e /workspace/<project>/…` or `:cd /workspace/<project>` first |

Maintenance:

- Logs: `journalctl --user -u kide`. Stop: `systemctl --user stop kide`
  (unsaved changes are lost; `:recover` brings them back from the swap files).
- After rebuilding the image (`podman build -t kide …`):
  `systemctl --user restart kide`.
- Another project directory: change the `Volume=%h/projects:…` line, then
  `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart kide`.

### C/C++ development

RHEL9 ships the heavy C/C++ tools itself, so they are **not** bundled; kide
uses them when installed (and skips them otherwise). `install.sh` installs
them: `gcc-c++ clang-tools-extra gdb lldb`.

- `clang-tools-extra`: clangd (LSP), clang-format (format on save),
  clang-tidy (runs inside clangd)
- `gdb` (16, speaks DAP itself) and `lldb` (`lldb-dap`): the two debug
  adapters; gdb is the default (also for cmake-tools and neotest-gtest)
- `cmake`, `make`, `gcc`/`gcc-toolset-*`, `clang`, `valgrind` as usual

Bundled for C/C++: neocmakelsp (CMake LSP), clangd_extensions.nvim,
cmake-tools.nvim, neotest + neotest-gtest, neogen, and the cpp, cmake, make
and doxygen parsers. Keys:

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `<leader>ch` / `cH` / `cs` | switch source/header, type hierarchy, symbol info |
| `<leader>mg` `mb` `mr` `md` | CMake generate, build, run, debug target |
| `<leader>mt` `mT` `ms` `mc` | select launch target, build target, build type; clean |
| `<leader>tr` `tt` `tT` `td` | run nearest test, file, all; debug nearest |
| `<leader>ts` `to` `tO` `tl` `tS` | test summary, output, output panel, run last, stop |
| `<leader>cn` | Doxygen/docstring skeleton for the function under the cursor |
| `<leader>d…` | debugging (pick "Launch (gdb)" or "Launch (lldb-dap)") |

cmake-tools builds into `build/<BuildType>` and links `compile_commands.json`
into the project root, which is what clangd reads.

#### C/C++ libraries

The libraries C/C++ projects build against (RHEL's opencv, glew, glfw, Qt5,
Python 3.12 with numpy and pybind11, and CMake 4, onnxruntime, ACE+TAO,
OpenDDS and GDAL with GTiff built from source) are not part of kide: they are
the **ibn-dev** build environment, a separate repo and podman image. Build
kide on top of it (`--build-arg BASE=localhost/ibn-dev`, see
[podman/README.md](podman/README.md#on-top-of-ibn-dev)) for the IDE and the
build environment in one container. kide knows nothing of ibn-dev: ibn-dev's
own shell hooks (`10-ibn-dev.sh`/`.fish` in `/workspace/.container/`) set its
library environment, in fish as in bash.

### Terminal tools

Also built from source and put on `PATH` with kide (upstream defaults; yazi
gets one setting, see below):

- `lazygit` — git TUI; inside kide on `<leader>gg` (root dir) / `<leader>gG` (cwd)
- `fish` — shell; the podman container's default shell, with the IDE's
  helpers from `fish/` (`config.fish`, `aliases.fish`: `vi` = kide, `lg` = lazygit, `y` = yazi (`Q` quits into its directory), `ll` = ls -alh, `ff` = fzf → kide, `ffex` = fzf over exported variables → clipboard; function `tm NAME` = tmux session, `fgo` = clipboard file positions → yazi, `clip_paste` = print the tmux paste buffer; `EDITOR` = kide). A
  normal install builds it too but keeps bash as the login shell.
- `yazi` + `ya` — file manager; text files (Enter, `o`) open in kide. `PREFIX/bashrc`
  sets `YAZI_CONFIG_HOME` to the bundled config (`yazi/yazi.toml`, installed
  to `PREFIX/share/kreatos-ide/yazi`), so a `~/.config/yazi` on the machine is
  not used. Needs RHEL's `file` for
  file-type detection (`install.sh` installs it). Code previews are highlighted for the languages
  of Sublime Text's own packages (Python, C/C++, shell, Lua, JSON, YAML,
  Markdown, Makefile, HTML/JS/TS, Rust, Go, …) plus CMake, TOML and
  Dockerfile; other text files preview as plain text, and so do HTML,
  TypeScript/JSX/TSX and PHP (their Sublime syntaxes are too new for
  syntect, as in upstream yazi).
  Content search (`S`, via `rg`) has match jumping from the plugin
  `search-jump-legacy` (`yazi/plugins/`, MIT, copied unchanged from
  mikemoik/plugins-yazi commit `d71b73c`, the variant for yazi 26.1.22; update
  it by copying a newer commit over it). In the result list the preview opens
  at the first match with all matches highlighted (needs `bat`), `n` / `b`
  step to the next / previous match, and `Enter` opens `$EDITOR` (kide in
  fish) at the match line. Outside search results `n`, `b`, `Enter` and the
  preview behave as before.
  `fgo` (fish) lists the file positions in the clipboard in yazi, with the
  plugin `fgo-legacy` (`yazi/plugins/`, MIT, copied unchanged from
  mikemoik/plugins-yazi commit `aca18ca`; `yazi/init.lua` loads it). Copy an
  error dump (compiler errors, tracebacks, rg output) and run `fgo` in the
  directory the paths are relative to. It finds `path:line[:col]`,
  `path(line[,col])` and python's `File "path", line N`. A path that does not
  exist as given is matched by its tail against the files below the current
  directory. yazi then shows one row per position, in the order found, with
  the preview at the line. `Enter` opens kide at the line and returns to the
  list when kide quits, `Esc` leaves to the real file's directory. With no
  positions, `fgo` just prints a message; `fgo -p` prints the list. In kide the
  clipboard is **tmux's paste buffer** (`clip_paste` in `fish/functions/`):
  select the text with a plain mouse drag in a tmux pane (no Shift). Text that
  is only in the Windows clipboard gets there with `tmux load-buffer -`,
  Shift+Insert, Ctrl+D.

  Inside kide, yazi.nvim opens yazi in a float: `<leader>fy` at the current
  file, `<leader>fY` at the root dir, `<leader>fz` resumes the last session
  (`F1` = its help). A picked file opens as a buffer in the same kide, which
  keeps its cwd; `q` closes the float. There is no zoxide in kide: yazi's
  default `Z` is unbound (`noop` in `yazi/keymap.toml`); jump with `z` (fzf)
  or by browsing.
- `fzf` — fuzzy finder

From packages, not built by kide (`install.sh` / the image install them):

- `tmux` — RHEL's; terminal multiplexer, `tm NAME` (fish) attaches to or
  creates a session with a top/bottom split
- `fd` — `fd-find` from EPEL; fast `find`, the snacks file pickers use it
- `rg` — `ripgrep` from EPEL; `:grep` (`grepprg`) and the snacks grep pickers
  use it
- `bat` — from EPEL; syntax-highlighted file viewer (`cat` with colors); yazi's
  search-jump preview renders through it

## Moving the repo to an on-prem GitLab

The repo is plain git (no LFS, no submodules; ~120 MB packed, largest file
25 MB), so any GitLab or other git server can host it. In GitLab, first
create an **empty** project (no README, no license): e.g.
`gitlab.example.com/kreatos/kide`. Below, replace that URL with
yours.

### Copy the repo over

**A machine that reaches both GitHub and the GitLab** — copy all
branches and tags:

    git clone --mirror https://github.com/kreatos/kide.git
    cd kide.git
    git push git@gitlab.example.com:kreatos/kide.git --all
    git push git@gitlab.example.com:kreatos/kide.git --tags

(`--all` + `--tags` rather than `push --mirror`: the GitHub mirror also holds
GitHub's pull-request refs, which GitLab rejects.)

**No such machine** (the GitLab is only reachable from the internal
network): carry a git bundle over, a single file holding the whole repo
with its history:

    # outside, with internet
    git clone --mirror https://github.com/kreatos/kide.git
    git -C kide.git bundle create "$PWD/kide.bundle" --branches --tags

    # inside, after copying kide.bundle (~115 MB) over
    git clone --mirror kide.bundle kide.git
    cd kide.git
    git push git@gitlab.example.com:kreatos/kide.git --all
    git push git@gitlab.example.com:kreatos/kide.git --tags

**Only the default branch** (`main` as on GitHub, with its history; no
other branches, no tags). Use a normal single-branch clone instead of the
mirror:

    git clone --single-branch https://github.com/kreatos/kide.git
    cd kide
    git push git@gitlab.example.com:kreatos/kide.git HEAD:refs/heads/main

As a bundle for the offline case (`HEAD` included, so a clone of it checks
out `main`):

    git bundle create "$PWD/../kide-main.bundle" HEAD main
    # inside:
    git clone kide-main.bundle kide
    cd kide
    git push git@gitlab.example.com:kreatos/kide.git HEAD:refs/heads/main

**Only the latest state, no history** (one fresh commit holding today's
files; it saves little, ~100 MB instead of ~115 MB, since the vendored
sources are most of the size, but the GitLab then holds no GitHub history):

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/kreatos/kide.git
    cd kide
    git checkout --orphan snapshot
    git commit -m "kide snapshot of $(git rev-parse --short origin/main)"
    git push git@gitlab.example.com:kreatos/kide.git snapshot:refs/heads/main
    # or for the offline case: git bundle create "$PWD/../kide-snapshot.bundle" snapshot
    # inside: git clone -b snapshot …-snapshot.bundle kide, then push as above

(`git commit` needs a git identity; on a fresh machine add
`-c user.name=… -c user.email=…` after `git`.) A later snapshot is unrelated
to the earlier one, so updating this way means pushing with `--force` or
starting a new project; for regular updates take the default branch with
history instead.

If a push over HTTPS fails with `413` / `RPC failed`, the server's upload
limit is too small for the first push: push over SSH (`git@…` URL as above)
instead.

**Later updates** go the same way: fetch from GitHub, then push to GitLab
(`git remote update` + the two `git push` lines in the mirror clone, or a
new bundle the same way). GitLab's
automatic pull mirroring needs a paid GitLab tier.

### Install from the GitLab

`install.sh` holds no repo URL; the one-call install takes the tarball URL
from `KIDE_TARBALL`, so pointing it at the GitLab needs no edit in the repo.

**Project readable without login** (visibility *internal* still needs a
login, so this means *public*):

    curl -fsSL https://gitlab.example.com/kreatos/kide/-/raw/main/install.sh \
      | KIDE_TARBALL=https://gitlab.example.com/kreatos/kide/-/archive/main/kide-main.tar.gz bash

**Private or internal project** (the usual case): clone with your GitLab
login, then install from the checkout. `install.sh` sees the checkout and
skips the download, so no URL needs changing:

    git clone https://gitlab.example.com/kreatos/kide.git
    cd kide
    ./install.sh

Updating later: `git pull` in that checkout, then `./install.sh` or
`./install.sh --no-build`.

The offline tarball install works the same with a tarball from GitLab
(project page → *Code* → *Download source code* → *tar.gz*). GitLab's tarball
unpacks to `kide-main-<commit>/` instead of
`kide-main/`, so `cd kide-main*/`.

**Podman image** from the GitLab: build from the clone (the
`podman build` command in it), as described in
[In a podman container](#in-a-podman-container). Building straight from the
URL only works for a project readable without login.

**Internal TLS certificate**: if `curl` or `git` fails with `SSL certificate
problem`, the GitLab uses a certificate from an internal CA. An admin adds
the CA to the system trust once (`sudo cp ca.crt
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ && sudo update-ca-trust`); don't switch
off TLS checks instead.

## What is inside

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `vendor/neovim` | Neovim source (`manifest/neovim.txt`) |
| `vendor/neovim-deps` | its bundled deps as source trees (libuv, LuaJIT, luv, lpeg, unibilium, utf8proc, tree-sitter, bundled parsers), pinned + sha256-checked by Neovim's `cmake.deps/deps.txt` |
| `vendor/plugins` | the plugins, plain source at pinned commits (`manifest/plugins.tsv`) |
| `vendor/grammars` | treesitter grammar repos (`grammar.js` + generated `src/parser.c`) |
| `vendor/tools` | LSP servers, formatters, debugger (`manifest/tools.tsv`): ruff + ty, neocmakelsp, shfmt, debugpy, fzf, lazygit, yazi, yazi-prebuilt (the syntax repos for yazi's previews); Go tools carry their modules in their own `vendor/` |
| `vendor/crates` | the Rust crates of each cargo tool (`cargo vendor --locked`), plus the cargo source config |
| `config` | the nvim config (kreatos `home/nvim`, adapted, see below) |
| `yazi` | the yazi config bundled with kide (text files open in kide), with the `search-jump-legacy` and `fgo-legacy` plugins in `yazi/plugins/` (`init.lua` sets up fgo-legacy) |
| `putty` | `kide.reg`: Windows PuTTY session with the kreatos colours ([PuTTY](#remote-kide-over-ssh-from-windows-putty)) |
| `windows-terminal` | `kide.json`: the same session as a Windows Terminal profile, with OSC 52 clipboard ([Windows Terminal](#windows-terminal-instead-of-putty-windows-terminalkidejson)) |
| `manifest/` | the pins; `parsers.lock.tsv` is generated from `parsers.txt`; `licenses.tsv` holds license facts the inventory cannot detect |
| `VERSIONS` | every vendored component with upstream URL and commit/tag/sha256 |

Binary files in upstream sources (images, test archives, wasm, the
`nvim.png` desktop icon, Windows import libraries) are stripped at vendor
time; nothing the build or the editor needs is lost.

Rust crates that the built binaries never compile on Linux — Windows/macOS/wasm
crates, test-only dependencies, crates only other workspace members need — are
reduced to stubs (their `Cargo.toml` only, so cargo can still resolve the
lockfile; `scripts/prune-crates.py`). `VERSIONS` marks them.

Build-time adjustments (applied to the build copy, the vendored tree stays
untouched):

- ruff/ty: bstr's `unicode` feature is switched off (ruff only uses its plain
  byte-string methods; the feature needs pregenerated binary DFA tables), and
  the matching `regex-automata` edge is dropped from Cargo.lock.
- yazi: its compiled syntax set (`yazi-prebuilt/built/syntaxes`, binary) is
  regenerated by yazi-prebuilt's own `generate.rs` from the `.sublime-syntax`
  files in `vendor/tools/yazi-prebuilt/syntaxes` (official, cmake, toml,
  docker: `YAZI_SYNTAXES` in `scripts/vendor-update.sh`), uncompressed as
  yazi 26.1.22 expects (the pinned `generate.rs` still compresses), and
  without syntect's own default dumps (stripped). ring's four DER
  templates (13–41 byte PKCS#8/AlgorithmIdentifier headers, included by
  yazi's SFTP code) are written from hex in `build-ide.sh`. Both go into a copy
  of the crate dir.

Why the Rust crates are vendored: ruff and ty are Rust programs, and
cargo normally downloads their library crates from crates.io at build time.
RHEL ships the Rust toolchain but no crates (no `rust-*-devel` packages, not
even in CRB), so every crate the build needs is in `vendor/crates` as source.

## Differences from the kreatos config

- No `vim.pack`: plugins are installed by `build-ide.sh` as opt packages and
  loaded with `packadd` in the same order.
- No claudecode.nvim (`<leader>a`), no jsonls / JSON schemas.
- blink.cmp uses its pure-Lua fuzzy matcher (the Rust one needs nightly Rust).
- Treesitter parsers are compiled by `build-ide.sh`; nvim-treesitter never
  installs anything.
- nvim-dap-python starts the bundled debugpy through `kide-python` (python3
  with the bundled debugpy on `PYTHONPATH`) instead of a system debugpy.
- LSP servers: `ty`, `ruff`, `clangd` (from RHEL), `neocmake` (no `lua_ls`);
  no Lua formatter (no stylua). C/C++ additions: see above.
  Lua files still get treesitter highlighting, indent and folds. A server
  whose binary is missing is skipped.

## Status

| Step | Content | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Neovim + plugins + parsers | done, passes in UBI9 offline |
| 2 | lua-language-server, stylua | built and tested, then dropped: no Lua development on the target |
| 3 | ruff + ty 0.15.11 (newest tag that builds with Rust 1.92) | done, passes in UBI9 offline |
| 4 | shfmt 3.13.1, debugpy 1.8.21 (last release for Python 3.9) | done, passes in UBI9 offline |
| C++ | parsers, neocmakelsp 0.11.0 (newest that builds with Rust 1.92), clangd_extensions, cmake-tools, neotest-gtest, neogen; config for RHEL's clangd/clang-format/gdb/lldb-dap | task 123 |
| tools | fzf 0.74.4, lazygit 0.65.1, yazi 26.1.22 (newest that builds with Rust 1.92; later ones need 1.95) | in progress |
| libs | moved to the ibn-dev repo (build environment) | task 126 |

## Updating the pins (on a connected machine)

1. Edit `manifest/` (Neovim tag, plugin commits, parser list).
2. `scripts/vendor-update.sh` — the only step that downloads; needs curl, tar,
   sha256sum, git, cargo, Python >= 3.11, an nvim to resolve the parser list,
   and Go (if not installed, RHEL's Go runs in a UBI9 container via docker).
3. Review `git status` / `VERSIONS` and the regenerated "Third-party
   software" section below (a new component with an unrecognised license
   stops the vendor run until it is added to `manifest/licenses.tsv`), commit.

<!-- inventory:start -->

## Third-party software

Everything vendored in this repo, with the pinned upstream version and its
