"""gen-inventory.py — rewrite the "Third-party software" section of README.md.

Reads VERSIONS (name, upstream URL, pin) and determines each component's
license: Rust crates from their Cargo.toml `license` field, everything else
from its license file(s), recognised by their wording. Licenses that cannot
be recognised come from manifest/licenses.tsv (name <TAB> SPDX expression).
The section between the inventory markers in README.md is replaced; the run
fails if a license stays unknown.

Runs at the end of scripts/vendor-update.sh (needs Python >= 3.11).
